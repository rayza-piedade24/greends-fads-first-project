5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
Copy all the files inside the directory one level above which include/begin with 'temp-'
5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
Since we used a a cloned repository as the base for the current one (it's already one)
5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
First, you must add all the copied files to the tracking system using:
$ git add .
Then commit all the files using:
$ git commit * -m "initial commit"
Afterwards use '$ git status' to confirm that it is stated that there is nothing to commit
